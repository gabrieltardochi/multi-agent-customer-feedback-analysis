### Summary

In the context of logistics, customer feedback provides valuable insights into the performance of our delivery services.

The persistent issue of late deliveries is a significant concern, as reflected in the negative sentiment scores throughout the year.

The improvement in Q4 sentiment is a promising development, suggesting that recent efforts to enhance logistics operations are beginning to pay off. However, the overall negative sentiment score indicates that there is still considerable room for improvement. Addressing the root causes of delivery delays and maintaining the momentum of positive changes will be crucial in transforming customer perceptions and enhancing the overall logistics experience.
